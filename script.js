log(chalk.red('Zoe looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else`s chimney.'));
log(chalk.green('"Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.'));
