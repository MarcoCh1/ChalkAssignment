Once upon a time there was a ruddy girl called Zoe Humble. She was on the way to see her friends Garth Greenway, when she decided to take a short cut through Gurglebridge. It wasn`t long before Zoe got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Blankey, but Blankey was nowhere to be found! Zoe began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Blankey. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry. Unexpectedly, she saw a wicked lizard dressed in a blue pinafore disappearing into the trees. "How odd!" thought Zoe. For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed lizard. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest. Eventually, Zoe reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from chocolates, a house made from humbugs and a house made from chips. Zoe could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger. "Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?" Nobody replied. Zoe looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else`s chimney. "Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.'
