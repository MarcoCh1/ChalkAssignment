Once apon a time where was a man named Sam who wished he could grow up to be like his Uncle Dan. He looked up to his every move and said "dang he's the man". But why did uncle Dan leave Sam so admiring. What was so inspring that left Sam so expiring. Was it the looks or the books he read constantly? Possiably, what could make him a such a, prodigy? Probably, the way he dressed? But honestly he doesn't have a way with fashion so that's just a guess. Or maybe the money? Isn't it funny that paper can difine success and say your blessed when you're mostly stressed. I digress back to Sam's confession. When growing up Dan never learned a lesson. Was constantly getting picked on and called a 'dum dum'
